' \'WEBVTT\n\n00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.479\nWelcome to this digital skills lesson by Flow State!\n\n00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.133\nIn this video, we\'ll learn how to create a strong\npassword and stay safe online.\n\n00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:13.485\nWe\'ll walk you through what to avoid and include\nin a password and share tips for protecting your accounts.\n\n00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:14.238\nReady?\n\n00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:15.271\nLet\'s start!\n\n00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.991\nSo let\'s look at what to avoid when it comes to creating\na password!\n\n00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.336\nFirst — avoid personal information.\n\n00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:28.594\nThat means no kids\' names, pets\' names, birthdays,\naddresses, phone numbers, or social security numbers.\n\n00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:31.066\nThese are the first things hackers will try.\n\n00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:36.278\nSecond — stay away from common words like \'cat,\'\n\'dog,\' \'mom,\' or \'dad.\' They\'re too easy to guess.\n\n00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:41.002\nRemember: if it\'s something people can learn about\nyou or something super common, don\'t use it in your\n\n00:00:41.002 --> 00:00:41.862\npassword.\n\n00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.980\nNow let\'s talk about what your password should look\nlike..\n\n00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.231\nFirstly, it should be at least 8 characters, 12 is\nbetter.\n\n00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.353\nUsing upper and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols.\n\n00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.243\nPlus, you should have different passwords for every\nsite.\n\n00:00:56.393 --> 00:01:00.433\nThat way a hacker can\'t access all of your accounts\nif they get one password.\n\n00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.211\nWell how do you sort that all out?\n\n00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.265\nYou can create a password formula!\n\n00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:09.549\nI\'ll show you how, but don\'t copy it exactly because\nyour formula should be your own.\n\n00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:10.488\nSo let\'s go!\n\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.136\nNumber 1- Always start the same way, using something\nunique.\n\n00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.723\nLet\'s use the airport code for a city like Minneapolis\nwhich is MSP.\n\n00:01:18.873 --> 00:01:24.829\nMix upper and lowercase letters, lowercase m, capital\nP, then replace the middle letter with a symbol, like\n\n00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:25.746\na dollar sign.\n\n00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:32.455\nSecondly add two letters from the website you\'re creating\na password for by using capital letters.\n\n00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:34.648\nLet\'s say we\'re using BestBuy.com.\n\n00:01:34.798 --> 00:01:38.560\nSo we can use ES from "Best" to further develop a\nstronger password.\n\n00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.472\nThen we can eventually add another symbol like at\nor exclamation marks.\n\n00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:47.196\nThen finish with your favourite number, but don\'t\nuse personal numbers like your birthday, which then\n\n00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:49.077\ncompletes this example password.\n\n00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.377\nFollow the same steps for every website you need credentials\nfor.\n\n00:01:53.527 --> 00:01:55.292\nHere\'s how it would look for Gmail.\n\n00:01:55.442 --> 00:01:58.600\nYou can see it\'s different, hard to crack, but easy\nfor you to remember.\n\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.608\nNow that we\'ve created a password that is safe, secure\nand easy to remember.\n\n00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:06.776\nLet\'s look at how we can stay safe online with our\npasswords shall we!\n\n00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:10.641\nNumber one- use a password manager.\n\n00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:13.949\nwhich creates and remembers strong, unique passwords\nfor you.\n\n00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.768\nThat way, you don\'t have to memorize them all, and\nyour accounts stay secure.\n\n00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:20.240\nNumber 2  avoid clicking suspicious links.\n\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.501\nCybercriminals often hide scams in emails or pop-ups.\n\n00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:26.205\nOne careless click can expose your personal info.\n\n00:02:26.355 --> 00:02:29.281\nThen number 3 always keep your apps and software\nupdated.\n\n00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.843\nUpdates aren\'t just new features — they fix security\nholes hackers might exploit.\n\n00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:36.965\nThink of them as repairs that keep your digital house\nsafe.\n\n00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.655\nWell done and thank you for watching the video!\n\n00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:44.474\nYou\'ve taken the time to learn the essentials, and\nthat\'s a big step forward.\n\n00:02:44.624 --> 00:02:48.339\nNow, to put your knowledge to the test, you\'ll be\ntaking a short quiz.\n\n00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.669\nThis will help you check what you\'ve learned and\nmake sure you\'re ready to apply it in practice!\''
